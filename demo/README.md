# Espressif ZeroCode

This document provides instructions to use the ESP ZeroCode product.

We assume that you now have a device with the flash programmed, either through the ZeroCode web portal, or by programming it yourself. If you are flashing the devices yourself from the downloaded zip, refer the [Firmware Flashing](#firmware-flashing) section first. Once done, please resume reading from this section.

> Note: This firmware has test certificates, which cannot be used for a production device. When you place an order, the ZeroCode modules will have the production certificates, as they should.

Please follow these instructions to get your device up and running.

## Setup Code

Scan the below QR Code from any of the Matter supported phone apps (details below) to setup the device.

> Note: Use the QR Code in the device's respective folder if you are flashing multiple devices yourself.
